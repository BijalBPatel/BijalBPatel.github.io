<br> 

NRC Postdoctoral Fellow with 6+ years of experience in polymer solution/melt processing and self-assembly (block copolymers/ organic semiconductors) including structural characterization via synchrotron X-ray GI(SAXS/WAXS). Experience in scientific software and instrument development. Interdisciplinary publication record including 18 refereed publications, 6 first author, ~950 citations.  

Currently working with the [NIST Polymers Processing Group](https://www.nist.gov/mml/materials-science-and-engineering-division/polymers-processing-group){:target="_blank"}, in the [Resonant Soft X-ray Scattering (RSoXS) Project](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/resonant-soft-x-ray-scattering-rsoxs){:target="_blank"}.

Formerly studying self-assembly and photonic properties of bottlebrush block copolymer solutions and melts as a graduate student in the [Diao Group](https://diao.scs.illinois.edu/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Illinois. 

A more detailed account of my scholarly work can be found in my [resume](../files/resume.pdf){:target="_blank"} and [Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qWFByPkAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}.
