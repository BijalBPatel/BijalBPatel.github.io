<br> 
I am a chemical engineer by training with 8+ years of research experience in Bioinformatics and Computational Genomics using Next Generation Sequencing. As a part of the [Integrated Data Sciences Section (IDSS)](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/research-technologies-branch-integrated-data-sciences) at the [National Institute of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/), Maryland US, I provided bioinformatics support to research groups at NIAID, NIAMS, NIDDK and NHLBI, performing data analysis and designing end to end workflows for various single cell and bulk transcriptomic and genomic datasets. 

My Ph.D. work was focused on generating insights about cellular behavior of different yeasts and bacteria using various genomics and bioinformatics data analyses. My advisor is [Prof. Christopher V. Rao](https://chbe.illinois.edu/directory/profile/cvrao){:target="_blank"} ([Rao Research Group](https://raogroupuiuc.github.io/webpage/){:target="_blank"}), and my research work is funded by the following grants by U.S. [Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/science/office-science){:target="_blank"}: Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation ([CABBI](https://cabbi.bio/){:target="_blank"}) and Genome Scale Engineering Center ([GSE](https://www.igb.illinois.edu/research-areas/gsecenter){:target="_blank"}).

I have previously been a part of [Unilever Future Leaders Programme](https://careers.unilever.com/unilever-future-leaders-programme){:target="_blank"} and worked as a Product Manager with [Unilever Research](https://www.hul.co.in/our-company/rd-innovation/our-rd-locations/mumbai-india/){:target="_blank"}. I am skilled in interdisciplinary research & project management in both academic and industry settings.

A detailed account of my work can be found in my [resume](../files/resume.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
